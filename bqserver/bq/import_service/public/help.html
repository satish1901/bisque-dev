<h2>Compressed files</h2>

<p>Bisque ingest system supports most common compressed file formats and operations.</p>

<ol><li>Supported formats: Zip and Tar</li></ol>

<p>Several operations can be applied after uncompressing the file:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ingest all files as a dataset of separate images</li>
<li>Combine all files in a multi-dimensional image and ingest</li>
</ol>

<h3>Multi-dimensional images</h3>

<p>Files contained in the compressed package must comply to our specifications. Currently we require:</p>

<li>All files are located in the root</li>
<li>They should be sortable alphanumerically</li>
<li>4D file names should be in the T-Z order (All Z positions for a given time point, then all Z positions for the next time point):</li>

<p>Example of the 4D file:</p>

<li>sample_4d.zip</li>
<li> - T000_Z0.tif</li>
<li> - T000_Z1.tif</li>
<li> - T000_Z2.tif</li>
<li> - T001_Z0.tif</li>
<li> - T001_Z1.tif</li>
<li> - T001_Z2.tif</li>
