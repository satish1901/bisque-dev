<h3>Return specific columns:</h3>
<li>[:, "colname1"], [: "colname2"]</li>

<h3>"Filter" operator is optional:</h3>
<li>filter:[:, "colname1"], [: "colname2"]</li>

<h3>Can also slice by column number:</h3>
<li>[:, 1], [:,3]</li>

<h3>For single slice, brackets can be left out:</h3>
<li>:,1</li>

<h3>Return column "colname3" for rows where value of column "colname1" is between "minval1" and "maxval1" and value of column "colname2" is between "minval2" and "maxval2":</h3>
<li>:,"colname3" { [:,"colname1"] > minval1 and [:,"colname1"] < maxval1 and [:,"colname2"] > minval2 and [:,"colname2"] < maxval2 }</li>

<h3>Or, equivalently:</h3>
<li>:,: { [:,"colname1"] > minval1 and [:,"colname1"] < maxval1 and [:,"colname2"] > minval2 and [:,"colname2"] < maxval2 }/:,"colname3"</li>
<p>(the initial ":,:" is needed to ensure all columns are passed through to the next filter step)</p>

<h3>Parentheses are OK:</h3>
<li>:,: { ([:,"colname1"] > minval1 and [:,"colname1"] < maxval1) or ([:,"colname2"] > minval2 and [:,"colname2"] < maxval2) }/:,"colname3"</li>

<h3>Return mean of column "colname3" for the same subset as above (the "as" is optional):</h3>
<li>:,: { [:,"colname1"] > minval1 and [:,"colname1"] < maxval1 and [:,"colname2"] > minval2 and [:,"colname2"] < maxval2 }/agg:mean(:,"colname3") as "my mean"</li>

<h3>Return min and max for column "colname3" for same subset:</h3>
<li>:,: { [:,"colname1"] > minval1 and [:,"colname1"] < maxval1 and [:,"colname2"] > minval2 and [:,"colname2"] < maxval2 }/agg:min(:,"colname3") as "my min", max(:,"colname3") as "my max"</li>
