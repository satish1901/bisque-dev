<h2>Compressed files</h2>

<p>Bisque ingest system supports most common compressed file formats and required operations.</p>

<li>Supported formats: Zip and Tar</li>

<p>Several operations can be applied after uncompressing the file:</p>

<li>Ingest all files as a dataset of separate images</li>
<li>Combine all files in a multi-dimensional image and ingest</li>

<h3>Multi-dimensional images</h3>

<p>Files contained in the compressed package must comply to our specifications. Currently we require:</p>

<li>All files are located in the root</li>
<li>They should be sorted alphanumerically</li>
<li>4D files should be in the Z-T order, where Z is most significative</li>

<p>Example of the 4D file:</p>

<li>sample_4d.zip</li>
<li> - T000_Z0.tif</li>
<li> - T000_Z1.tif</li>
<li> - T000_Z2.tif</li>
<li> - T001_Z0.tif</li>
<li> - T001_Z1.tif</li>
<li> - T001_Z2.tif</li>
