    Process your image/dataset with one of the pre-built CellProfiler pipelines. For details see the link:

    <b>Human cells</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Human HT29 cells are fairly smooth and elliptical. This pipeline demonstrates how to accurately identify these cells and how to measurements cellular parameters such as morphology, count, intensity and texture.

    <b>Tissue neighbors</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    Tissue samples often have irregularly shaped cells with adjacent edges. This pipeline shows how to input a color tissue image, split it into its component channels, and then identify individual cells from a particular stain and record the number of neighbors that each cell has.

    <b>Wound healing</b>
    <br>
    <br>
    In this example, cells are grown as a tissue monolayer. Rather than identifying individual cells, this pipeline quantifies the area occupied by the tissue sample.
