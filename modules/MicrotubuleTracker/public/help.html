    <h2>Help and workflow</h2>

    <p>Microtubule (MT) Tracker is designed to track individual MTs in grayscale time-lapse images. You can upload a time-lapse image from your local 
    storage or work on images that are already in BISQUE environment.</p>
    
    <h2>Selecting a MT</h2>
    
    <p>1. Open your time-lapse image by double-clicking it in "Select an Image" or "Upload local images" tabs on the left.</p>
    <p>2. From the menu, select "POLYLINE". Click to mark a polyline on a microtubule on first frame, which you wish to track.</p>
    <p>3. Click "RUN" button in section 2. Execution may take some time, depending on the complexity of image sequence.</p>
    <p>4. The tracking result will appear in section 3, and will be stored in BISQUE for later use. The result can be exported as TEXT, EXCEL FILE, XML, 
    or visualized as overlaid on image.</p>
    
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    
    <p>The tracking algorithm is sensitive to the quality of provided image. E.g. if a blank image is provided, and an arbitrary polyline is given, the 
    resulting MT track will not be a meaningful track.</p>
    
    <p>While most image and microscopy formats are supported by BISQUE, there may be newer formats that are not supported.  Please contact BISQUE team 
    in such cases.</p>
