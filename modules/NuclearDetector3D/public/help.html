    <h2>Help and workflow</h2>
    <p>We start with a laser scanning confocal 3D stack that has a nuclear stain channel. In 3D the stack looks like this:</p>
    <p><img src="images/nucleur_3d.png" alt="3D stack" width="250" height="250" /></p>
    <p>Single plain of the stack looks like this:</p>
    <p><img src="images/nucleur_plain.png" alt="Plain" width="250" height="250" /></p>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p><strong>Nuclei size: </strong>We have approximately measured the size of the nucleus and obtained 3 microns. This value we will enter as &quot;Nuclei Size&quot; parameter. </p>
    <p><strong>Low intensity bound: </strong>We would also like to reject 20% of lower intensity levels as a valid response of a nuclei, so we set 0.2 as a &quot;Low intensity level&quot;.</p>
    <p><strong>Pixel size: </strong>If the image has embedded meta-data then both pixel resolution X/Y and Z will be filled automatically. If you would want to change these values, they will be stored in the appropriate image tag and preserved.</p>
    <p><strong>Channels</strong> are selected by number and nuclear channel must to be present. You can also select a membrane channel if it exists, this could help to filter out incorrectly detected centroids.</p>
