<p><em>This is a public Beta 3, so please, bear with us if something breaks and don't hesitate to leave <a href="mailto:bisque-help@biodev.ece.ucsb.edu">your comments, bug

<p>This application allows you to select local file or an image in the Bisque database and automatically identify nuclear centroid locations in 3D/4D fluorescent microscopic 
imagery. These locations can be exported as text, excel file, XML or visualized overlayed on image. Simple statistics can be obtained from detected nuclei. Furthermore these 
locations can be used for additional analysis such as segmentation.</p>    
    
    
    <p>We start with a laser scanning confocal 3D stack that has a nuclear stain channel. In 3D the stack looks like this:</p>
    <p><img src="images/nucleur_3d.png" alt="3D stack" width="250" height="250" /></p>
    <p>Single plain of the stack looks like this:</p>
    <p><img src="images/nucleur_plain.png" alt="Plain" width="250" height="250" /></p>
    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p><strong>Nuclear size: </strong>We have approximately measured the size of the nucleus and obtained 3 microns. This value we will enter as &quot;Nuclei Size&quot; parameter. </p>
    <p><strong>Low intensity bound: </strong>We would also like to reject 20% of lower intensity levels as a valid response of a nuclei, so we set 0.2 as a &quot;Low intensity level&quot;.</p>
    <p><strong>Pixel size: </strong>If the image has embedded meta-data then both pixel resolution X/Y and Z will be filled automatically. If you would want to change these values, they will be stored in the appropriate image tag and preserved.</p>
    <p><strong>Channels</strong> are selected by number and nuclear channel must to be present. You can also select a membrane channel if it exists, this could help to filter out incorrectly detected centroids.</p>
